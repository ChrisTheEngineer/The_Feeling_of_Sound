# The Feeling of Sound
Development of a device that amplifies the experience of listening to music using haptic technologies.

#Project Description
Project originally created using Visual Studio 2015 RC on Windows 8.1

The overall objective was to create a wristband containing small vibrating motors that would vibrate along with audio, thereby enhancing the listening experience.  Specific goals included to use a Bluetooth communication with the wristband, to write a computer program to control it, and to determine the most effective way to translate sound into a tactile experience.

FFT data from a song is used to determine the when the bass frequencies are highest. The intensity of the bass is sent serially to an arduino board to vibrate motors. This helps provide a more interactive and better experience.
